</p>

## Project Description
This project is an interactive image slider that allows you to showcase multiple images with accompanying text captions. Users can navigate through the images using the previous and next buttons. The slider provides a visually appealing way to present a collection of images or create a slideshow.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the image slider.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styling rules to format the appearance of the image slider.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling the slider functionality, such as changing the slides and implementing the fade-in animation.


## Instructions
To use the image slider
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You will see the first image and its caption displayed.
4. Click the "Next" button (`>`) to view the next image in the slider.
5. Click the "Previous" button (`<`) to view the previous image.
6. The slider will loop back to the first image when reaching the end or the last image when going backwards.
